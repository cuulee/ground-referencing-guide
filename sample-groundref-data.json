Her number would look like 1.#.#. #2 refers to the number field you are at. For example, if we are surveying the 4th field of the day with Josephine; the ID would be 1.04. If there is no third number that means all the information is known about this field. #3 refers to if the field is an adjacent field. An adjacent field is constituted by being a field in the area we are working but little to none of the information is known. Typically fields with a 3rd number just have a polygon and a crop.",
